    "# Exercise 8: hydrocarbons on platinum: functional-sensitive adsorption energies\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: Wednesday, 19. April 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission deadline**: Sunday, 23. April 2023 (or Sunday, 30. April 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Introduction to the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will continue our study of density-functional theory (DFT) by considering the adsorption of three hydrocarbons -- benzene, methane, and ethane -- on a platinum slab. In principle, there are three candidates as adsorption sites, namely directly centered on top of a Pt atom, on the bridge connecting two Pt atoms, or on a hollow juncture in the middle of four Pt atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three different hydrocarbons on the Pt(111) surface.](hydrocarbons_on_pt.png \"Figure 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is to simulate the chemisorption of these hydrocarbons on platinum: in chemisorption, interactions between the molecule and substrate lead to bonds being formed, such that the bonds within the molecule and the surface are rearranged. We will be making use of [this paper [1]](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2015/cp/c5cp04534g) in the course of this exercise. The first step is to make use of the definition of the adsorption energy $E_{ads}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "E_{ads} =  E_{total} - \\sum_{slab, \\, molecules} E_{separate \\, system}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for our system:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{ads} = E_{total} - E_{Pt \\, slab} - E_{molecule}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Practically this means that three geometry optimizations are necessary: the first consisting of the total system of the molecule and the slab; the second with only the molecule; and the third with only the slab. However, not all DFT calculations can reproduce this result. Because of their different properties and approximations for the exchange–correlation (XC) part, *different DFT functionals predict different properties*, especially in regards to van der Waals interactions, which we have indeed already met in the third exercise via the Lennard-Jones potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every functional has its advantages and disadvantages and can be more or less suitable for the specific system and/or property that you want to study. Thus, it is necessary to understand the limits of the functional that you want to use, e.g. searching in the literature or performing some preliminary benchmark calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a flavour of how properties can change, in this exercise we (you) will investigate two from the same family of approximations to the XC energy, namely the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional, and we will use the GGA with vdW corrections: thus, in this exercise, we will examine a total of two different XC functionals, both with vdW corrections. Different from exercise 3, this time, we will include the vdW correction via the BEEF-vdW XC functional instead of via a simple LJ potential. In any case, the vdW correction is an energy term which is added *a posteriori* to the energy functional obtained from the variational principle of DFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GGA formalism goes a step further than that of the local density approximation, accounting also for the local change of the electron density, with the inclusion of the electron density gradient in the functional. GGA functionals go through another division based on the origin of their parameters: They can be either empirical, i.e. derived from fitting of data coming from experiments and more sophisticated techniques, or determined from properties of the homogeneous electron gas as well as exact constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA generally overestimates the bond strength between the molecule and the surface, since it is more suitable to describe strong bonds. This leads to a calculated overbinding, such as short adsorption bond lengths, large chemisorption energies, and high molecule–surface vibrational frequencies. The error in the chemisorption energy can be so large that LDA may predict the wrong chemisorption site. Finally, by considering vdW corrections via the BEEF-vdW functional, we take into account non-local effects which may play a role in the chemisorption process."

    "We can see, that the BEEF-vdW method performs better, than the Grimme D3 one. This is not surprising, when knowing long both simulations took. While the longest of BEEF-vdW took around 2.5h, the longest using Grimme-D3 only took around 1h. Of course this is not directly a measure of accuracy but maybe a hint at it. Furthermore Grimme D3 seems to overestimate adsorbtion energy."

As we can see below, the H atoms are pointing away from the Platinum slab as we would axpect, as the H atoms can't really make a bond, as they have no free electron, unless they would break the bond with the C atom, which is highly unlikely."

    "\n",
    "In the above geometry optimizations, you've probably noticed that the molecule \"buckles\" a little bit: this is due to the molecule's interaction with the substrate, which in turn performs work on the molecule to reach a total energy minimum. The objective of this optional assignment will be to calculate mechanical (or really... electrostatic) work that the substrate performs on the molecule. This simply amounts to the energy difference between the relaxed molecule in the gasphase $E_{\\text{gasphase}}^{\\text{relaxed}}$ and the energy of *just the molecule* in the relaxed adsorption configuration on the surface. Since we already have $E_{\\text{gasphase}}^{\\text{relaxed}}$ from our calculations from previous steps, we just need to extract the energy of the molecule on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the molecule for which you see the \"most\" deformation in the course of the geometry optimization on the platinum slab (e.g., benzene on platinum, methane on platinum, or ethane on platinum. In any case, make sure it's the *total* system geometry that you choose, and not just the slab nor just the molecule in this first step).\n",
    "2. Take the relaxed geometry configuration (i.e., the last block of lines in the `-pos-1.xyz` file, including the number of atoms line and the comment line directly underneath) and store them to a new file: `tail -<however many lines> something-pos-1.xyz > final_config.xyz`.\n",
    "3. Delete the atoms of the slab (so that only the atoms of the molecule remain), and adjust the total number of atoms (first line) accordingly.\n",
    "3. Perform an `ENERGY` run on this `final_config.xyz` configuration: remember what an `ENERGY` run is --- all it does is simply compute the energy of a given configuration; it does *not* optimize the geometry. Perform an energy run by modifying the `RUN_TYPE` parameter in the input file from `GEO_OPT` to `ENERGY` and changing the name of the `COORD_FILE_NAME` parameter to `final_config.xyz`; it might also be sensible to change the name of the `PROJECT` in the `&GLOBAL` section. Once all these changes have been made, submit the calculation. Once it's finished, you have $E_{\\text{mol on slab}}^{\\text{relaxed}}$ \n",
