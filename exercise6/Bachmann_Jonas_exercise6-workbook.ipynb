    "# Exercise 5: the formation of molecular oxygen using molecular orbital theory\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise examines the formation of **triplet oxygen**, the most stable and most common allotropic form of O$_2$. Triplet oxygen has two electrons in its two **degenerate** (i.e., having the same energy, or, more formally, two distinct microstates corresponding to the same macrostate) $\\pi^*$ orbitals. There are four independent spin states arising from these two spin-1/2 electrons, and so there are a total of $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible ways (microstates) to arrange the two electrons into the two degenerate $\\pi^*$ orbitals. Here, we will only consider the triply-degenerate ground state: according to **Hund's rules**, the configuration with two unpaired electrons in two $\\pi^*$ orbitals is energetically favoured.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, you will generate a [molecular orbital schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplet_oxygen#/media/File:Valence_orbitals_of_oxygen_atom_and_dioxygen_molecule_(diagram).svg) for triplet oxygen, that is, the configuration for which the total spin equals 1."

In order to compute these differences, we use a tool called [cubecruncher](https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/tools/cubecruncher), which allows us to perform various operations on cube files -- notably subtraction.\n",

To do this, we run two more simulations (ie, one for each of the individual atoms), whereby each simulation will generate the electron density (in turn, contained in its respective cube file) of that respective oxygen atom.\n",

    "The \"reference\" plot is with the values given in the exercise, the \"molecule\" and \"atom\" are from my calculations.\n",

    "When comparing to the \"molecule\", we can see a nice splitting of the 2s orbitals into binding and antibinding $\\sigma 2s^{(*)}$ orbitals (indicated by the dashed lines). \n",
    "And also the 2p orbitals are splitted into binding and antibinding $\\pi p_{x, y}^{(*)}$ and $\\sigma p_z^{(*)}$ orbitals. \n",
    "Note that the antibinding $\\sigma p_z^{*}$ orbital is not present, because it's not yet occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why I have also plotted the reference values, can bee seen in the plots. The down spin atoms tend to have a higher eigen energy value as they should,\n",
    "and hence we do not clearly see, whether the two antibinding $\\pi_x^*$ prbitals are twice occupied or only once in the \"molecule\" plot. \n",
    "Additionally, all the eigen energies seem to be slighly higher than my computed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the reference values, its clear, that the $\\pi p_x^{*}$ and $\\pi p_{y}^{*}$ orbitals are only single occupied and hence there are two unpaired electrons. And hence by definition, $O_2$ is paramagnetic."
